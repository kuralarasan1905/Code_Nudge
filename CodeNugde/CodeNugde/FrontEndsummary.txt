- **TypeScript Compiler** - Strict type checking enabled

## 5. Key Files & Purpose

### Configuration Files:
- **angular.json**: Angular CLI configuration, build settings, and project structure
- **package.json**: Dependencies, scripts, and project metadata
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript compiler configuration with strict mode
- **app.config.ts**: Application providers and dependency injection setup

### Core Application Files:
- **main.ts**: Application bootstrap with standalone component architecture
- **app.ts**: Root component with navigation and router outlet
- **app.routes.ts**: Complete routing configuration with lazy loading
- **app.html**: Root template with navigation and main content area

### Model Files:
- **user.model.ts**: User roles, profiles, and authentication interfaces
- **question.model.ts**: Coding questions, test cases, and question types
- **interview.model.ts**: Mock interview structures and feedback systems
- **dashboard.model.ts**: Analytics, metrics, and dashboard data structures
- **balance.model.ts**: Payment, subscription, and credit system models
- **api-interfaces.model.ts**: Comprehensive API response interfaces

## 6. Data Flow

### Authentication Flow:
1. User logs in through AuthService
2. JWT token stored in localStorage
3. User role determines navigation (student/admin routes)
4. AuthService maintains reactive user state using signals

### Student Practice Flow:
1. Student selects coding problem from practice list
2. Code editor loads with language templates
3. CodeExecutionService handles code compilation and testing
4. Results displayed with test case feedback
5. Progress tracked in DashboardService

1. Admin accesses management interfaces
2. CRUD operations through respective services
3. Real-time updates using reactive signals
4. Analytics data aggregated for dashboard display
